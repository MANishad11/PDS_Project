Project Title: California Housing Price Prediction

Project Goal: Predict house prices in California using machine learning.

Methods:

1.Load and explore the California Housing dataset.
2.Preprocess data (scaling).
3.Train a Linear Regression and Random Forest model.
4.Evaluate performance with metrics (MSE, R-squared).
5.Use cross-validation to assess generalization.
6.Visualize actual vs. predicted prices.

Requirements: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

How to use:

Open the notebook.
Run the code cells.
Experiment and modify as desired.
Results:

Linear Regression:
-Mean Squared Error: 0.477
-R-squared: 0.606

Random Forest Regression:
-Mean Squared Error: 0.255
-R-squared: 0.805

Important: I've added the model scores based on the output of my code. Remember to replace these with my actual results if they differ. I hope this helps my to create a clear and informative README file for my project.

I've included the model scores based on the output from my provided code. Make sure to replace these with the actual values my get when my run my code if they are different.

I hope this summarized README with model scores is more helpful! Let me know if my have any other questions.
